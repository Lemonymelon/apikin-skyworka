# Star Wars - API Tech Test

## Brief:
“We would like you to build a React project that connects to the StarWars API:
https://swapi.dev/

Your application should display a searchable and paginated list of characters, listing attributes of your choosing.
Using the data returned (skin_color, hair_color, etc) create a dynamically styled avatar for each.

We would like you to build this project as if the next stage was to display the cast members of each film.

If you could submit this to GitHub complete with a readme, we will be looking at your approach, code’s structure,
coding standards and reusability.”
