- background - hyperjump slow eternal gif
- container - yellow border, round edges, very dark blue interior
- avatar component: hair (same as skin if N/A), face, eyes, smile (fixed)
- hide/show characteristics
- search bar (person name)
- react router - characters, actors
- actors/films: TBC opening crawl
- properties (e.g. homeworld) come as links; api call in component? translate in initial api call (planet name & id)?
- api - DRY vs single use principle (multiple search fields)
- no results: these are not the droids you're looking for
